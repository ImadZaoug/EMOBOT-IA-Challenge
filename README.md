# EMOBOT IA Challenge

## Introduction

The EMOBOT IA Challenge focuses on detecting changes through multi-image, multi-date remote sensing, crucial for understanding global conditions. This challenge involves using features obtained from satellite images through computer vision and further processing them using machine learning techniques.

## Challenge Description

The goal of this challenge is to classify a given geographical feature into one of six classes based on various attributes, including:

1. Irregular polygon shape
2. Status of the polygon on five different dates
3. Neighborhood urban features
4. Neighborhood geographic features

The classes to be predicted are as follows:

- Demolition: 0
- Road: 1
- Residential: 2
- Commercial: 3
- Industrial: 4
- Mega Projects: 5

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves converting urban and geographic types into categorical columns using one-hot encoding. Additionally, various properties of irregular polygons, such as area and perimeter, can be extracted as features. The duration between consecutive dates can also be used as a feature.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following files:

- `train.geojson`: Training set
- `test.geojson`: Test set
- `skelton_code.py`: Starter code

The columns in the dataset include dates, polygon statuses, neighborhood urban and geographic types, and the target label to be classified.

## Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is the Mean F1-Score, which balances both recall and precision equally. A good retrieval algorithm maximizes both precision and recall simultaneously. Thus, moderate performance across all metrics is favored over extreme performance in one metric at the expense of another.

## Project Structure

- `Consignes_Challenge_IA.pdf`: Instructions for the challenge
- `ml-challenge-stage-emobot-zaoug-imad.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code
- `test.geojson`: Test dataset
- `train.geojson`: Training dataset

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see requirements.txt).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`ml-challenge-stage-emobot-zaoug-imad.ipynb`) to execute the project code.

## Conclusion

This project aims to address the challenge of classifying geographical features using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the dataset, performing feature engineering, and testing various models, we aim to build a robust classification model capable of accurately predicting land use changes.
